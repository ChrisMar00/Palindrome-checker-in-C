# Palindrome checker in C

This script helps you check if a string is a palindrome using C language.
The script isn't case sensitive so you can use both lower or upper case letters.
To use the script just compile it in a terminal and add the word you want to check as an argument:

./palindrome racecar

-racecar is palindrome!

./palindrome lighthouse

-lighthouse isn't palindrome!

If no or more than one argument is passed, an error is raised:

Usage:
./palindrome 'string'
